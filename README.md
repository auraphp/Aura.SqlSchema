# Aura.Sql_Schema

This library provides facilities to read table names and table columns from a
database using a _PDO_ connection.


## Preliminaries

### Installation and Autoloading

This library is installable via Composer and is registered on Packagist at

requires PHP version 5.3 or later (as opposed to most other Aura libraries,
which require PHP 5.4 or later).

### Tests

## Getting Started

### Instantiation

Instantiate a driver-specific schema object with a matching database
connection:

```php
<?php
use Aura\Sql_Schema\MysqlSchema;
use PDO;

$connection = new PDO(...);
$schema = new MysqlSchema($connection);
?>
```


Retrieving Schema Information
-----------------------------

To get a list of tables in the database, issue `fetchTableList()`:

```php
<?php
$tables = $schema->fetchTableList();
foreach ($tables as $table) {
    echo $table . PHP_EOL;
}
?>
```

To get information about the columns in a table, issue `fetchTableCols()`:

```php
<?php
$cols = $schema->fetchTableCols('table_name');
foreach ($cols as $name => $col) {
    echo "Column $name is of type "
       . $col->type
       . " with a size of "
       . $col->size
       . PHP_EOL;
}
?>
```

Each column description is a `Column` object with the following properties:

- `name`: (string) The column name

- `type`: (string) The column data type.  Data types are as reported by the database.

- `size`: (int) The column size.

- `scale`: (int) The number of decimal places for the column, if any.

- `notnull`: (bool) Is the column marked as `NOT NULL`?

- `default`: (mixed) The default value for the column. Note that sometimes
  this will be `null` if the underlying database is going to set a timestamp
  automatically.

- `autoinc`: (bool) Is the column auto-incremented?

- `primary`: (bool) Is the column part of the primary key?
